## Why ABMs interest me

- Computer Science background
- I like to code
- I like to think about social issues

## Psychology is complicated

e.g. Communal motivation involves

- Cultural continuity
- Ostracism
- Social embeddedness
- Social capital
- Commitment mechanisms
- Social media
- Identity fusion
- .........

## Psychology is complicated

- How do we combine ideas?
- Which effects are dominant?
- Generalizability

## Motivation

- Replication crisis
- Social scientists make poor real world predictions [@grossmannWhenExpertPredictions2024]
- Is human behaviour too complicated for our toolkit?

Obstacles to accurate predictions [@grossmannWhenExpertPredictions2024]

## Where ABMs Can Help

- Combining theories
- Flexible Analyses
- High fidelity
- Personal development?

## Parts of an Agent-based Model

Environment

- Network
- Discrete grid
- Continuous space

Agents

Time Step

## Parts of an Agent-based Model

Time 0

- Generate environment
- Generate agents and place them in the environment

Time 1, 2, 3, ..., Stop

- Agents activate
- The environment can change

## What to model?

Evolution

- Simple premise
- Constant thread through theories


## Implementing a simple idea

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- What is an obvious evolutionary relationship?
- How can we show this using agents?

## Software

- Python
- Mesa [@terhoevenMesa3Agentbased2025]
- pandas [@thepandasdevelopmentteamPandasdevPandasPandas2025; @mckinneyDataStructuresStatistical2010]
- seaborn [@waskomSeabornStatisticalData2021]
- Altair [@vanderplasAltairInteractiveStatistical2018; @satyanarayanVegaLiteGrammarInteractive2017]

## How does fitness relate to prevalence?

- Each agent has a fitness value
- This fitness value has to affect the agent's reproduction

## How does fitness relate to prevalence?

```{.python code-line-numbers="false"}
class Agent:
  self.fitness

  reproduce():
    self.fitness -> probability of success

  step():
    reproduce()
```

Is simplicity the goal?

## My first implementation

```{.python code-line-numbers="false"}
class Agent:
  self.fitness
  self.energy

  feed():
    self.fitness -> probability of +2 energy

  reproduce():
    always successful
  
  metabolism():
    self.energy - 1
  
  step():
    metabolism()
    reproduce()
    if self.energy < 0 then remove agent
    else feed()
```
