# Background

Social psychology has a problem of complexity.
This problem is not unique to social psychology or the social sciences [@macyFactorsActorsComputational2002], but the approaches that social psychologists use to study social psychology have had limited success [@grossmannWhenExpertPredictions2024; @opensciencecollaborationEstimatingReproducibilityPsychological2015; @muthukrishnaProblemTheory2019].
Following the replication crisis, there has been an increased focus in the social sciences on rigour in research process, leading to the creation and adoption of open science practices [@nosekReplicabilityRobustnessReproducibility2021; @bauerPsychologicalScienceStepping2022].
A survey of psychology researchers found that they perceived the benefits of preregistration most for planning analyses and generating hypotheses [@sarafoglouSurveyHowPreregistration2022].
Others argued that a major reason for the replication crisis in psychology is a lack of cohesion in the theoretical foundations guiding research [@muthukrishnaProblemTheory2019].
Recently, a large sample of experts in the social sciences participated in a survey to gather their predictions for different domains of societal change following the COVID-19 pandemic [@grossmannWhenExpertPredictions2024]. 
They found that social scientists did not perform better than chance for this task, in contrast to previous studies that found social scientists performed better than laypeople in predicting the outcomes of laboratory experiments of these same domains [@grossmannWhenExpertPredictions2024]. 
This gap in prediction accuracy was attributed to inadequate causal models [@grossmannWhenExpertPredictions2024].
Together these findings suggest that social psychologists lack theories that encompass the complexity of social phenomena in the real world.

## A Problem of Complexity

Experimental designs allow us to isolate causal relationships between variables, but extending this approach to systematically define multiple aspects of a phenomenon quickly leads to a combinatorial explosion.
Overarching theoretical frameworks are the opposite in this regard.
Rather than having to test an impractically large space of possible hypotheses to develop comprehensive models, a theoretical framework defines a limited space of possibilities that can be supported or disproven by existing or new data [@muthukrishnaProblemTheory2019].
The authors argue that dual inheritance theory, an evolutionary theory, is a suitable framework to guide reasoning for social behaviours [@muthukrishnaProblemTheory2019]. 
Evolutionary theories are bottom-up approaches that can produce higher level outcomes emerging from the consequences of lower level mechanisms [@millerBottomupApproachClear1994].
Transitioning from top-down to bottom-up theories could provide social psychology with models that describe the complexity in the real world, but this complexity becomes part of the model.

## A Problem of Emergence

At first glance, it may seem that using bottom-up theories to understand complex systems is merely shifting the problem of understanding complexity from the system to the model itself.
For example, evolutionary approaches to understanding human cooperation has yet to describe the breadth of cooperative behaviours observed in the real world [@henrichOriginsPsychologyHuman2021]. 
This is an inherent challenge of a bottom-up approach. 
The phenomenon we are interested in becomes an emergent property of the theory rather than an explicit part.
But reorienting the phenomenon into a bottom-up view does allow for 

## Exploring Large Spaces

We can reason about how the different variables in a model can interact, but this can miss unintuitive interactions and is limited by mathematical analysis tools.

# Simulations

Systematic exploration of all possible states.
Numeric approximations of unsolvable mathematical systems.

## Agent-Based Modelling

Bridge between simulation and description.
Individuals as the unit for interactions.

## Example From Psychology

# Making an ABM

Going from theory to individual level behaviour rules.
Environment details matter.

## Programming Considerations

Languages have differences.
Python often used for experiments and analyzing data.

# Toy Model

I saw evolutionary psychology as a great fit for a beginner model because evolutionary theory focuses on individual-level interactions.

## Creation

I had some familiarity with Python and knew it had good adoption among scientists.
I was informed about the Mesa package.
The modelling process started by implementing the most basic variables and relationship.

## Analysis

We can collect data at both the individual and aggregate level for whatever properties we wish.
Then we can see if the relationships we expect to see are supported by the data.
We can also represent the rules from the code as a flowchart to illustrate all the different variables interacting to create the outcome.

# Discussion

Implementing a form of parental investment theory required me to consider all the variables surrounding the obvious ones.
e.g. ability to get food affects relative population size only because the environment has a limited carrying capacity.
e.g. if the population has high average fitness, then choosing higher fitness individuals is less necessary, at least in this model where fitness had an upper bound.

## Limitations

Creating this kind of theory requires deconstructing people and thinking about incentives.
It's not a flattering view of humanity.

## Potential

Common language of mathematics.
Opportunity to see the potential interactions between many causal relationships.

## Conclusion

Modelling a theory is potentially a good exercise to get a deeper understanding of the theory.
Agent-based modelling can show outcomes of interactions between many variables.
Using math to express ideas is an avenue for connecting theories together.
